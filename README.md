I like to make all sorts of things. So I'm learning all the time!

My general approach is to throw electronics and code at things until they are better.

### Hobbies

3D Printing - Sometimes I design things. Sometimes I don't.

D.I.Y. Electronics - Who doesn't like shiny lights? also things go zoom.

Prop Making - Foam and contact cement makes me cool robot helmets and other weird objects.

Game development - Video games are fun but making them is funner.
